## Description
Creation of a REST API. This service simulates cases that could happen in a social media application (I gave it the fictional name ofPhotogram).

## Use cases
* Ping to know if the service is active.
* A user can get a session token.
* You can add a user as a fan to follow.
* You can get a list of fanatics you are following.
* You can create a report of fans you are following (JSON or XML format).
* Get a fan’s publications.
* Comment on a post.
* Get all comment’s post.
* Update a comment.
* Delete a comment

## Design

### General
This Web service was built using the standard REST. As a platform I used Spring Boot Framework.

### Datasource
I use a free fake API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a data source.
I have used the following fake resources: Users, Posts and Comments.
They seemed enough to reflect a basic social network.

### Reports
It is also necessary to be able to extract information, I implemented it thinking of a report of fanatics.
To generate the JSON file I use the Google Gson library. And for the generation of the XML file I used Jackson because Gson only converts to JSON.

### Architecture

![Clean Architecure - Uncle bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/images/2012-08-13-the-clean-architecture/CleanArchitecture.jpg)

For this project use Clean Architecture of Uncle Bob, because I think it’s a good way to organize the code by simplifying development and maintenance at a general level.

For exception handling I used @ControllerAdvice to catch exceptions across the whole application. It also separates them according to the layer that can throw it.

For the creation of a container for the service I use Docker, because Docker today is the most used platform.
With this container we can implement CI/CD with Jenkins for example. It also allows us to separate the infrastructure from the service. Allowing us to create instances (develop, test, production)

## Technical debts/ improvements
* URL’s endpoint that consume can be static and final or It can go in a configuration file.
* The logic of the reports are in a service and not in a use case.
* Add Circuit breakers to prevent the failure from cascading and giving the failing service time to recover. For example using Hystrix (There is a pull request with a sketch).
* Improve the responsiveness of JSON and XML reports.It may be necessary to return the created content.
